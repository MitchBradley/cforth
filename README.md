cforth
======
This is Mitch Bradley's CForth implementation.

This version was derived from the version at One Laptop Per Child,
then it was improved as follows:

a) Host version now has line editing
b) Host version catches exceptions
c) key and key? implemented property in host versions for Linux and Windows
d) Makefile fragments factored better, and use pattern rules extensively
e) Makefiles in build directories simplified
