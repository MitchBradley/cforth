0 [if]   tasking_rtos.fth for cforth on an ESP32.
Based on tasking.fth written by Mitch Bradley.
Modified by J.v.d.Ven September 25th, 2021
an experimental pre-emptive multitasking system under RTOS
Example: ~/cforth/src/app/esp8266-rtos/tests/pe_tasking.fth


Issues:
1) Use MS only after all tasks are running  OR  use it before the first time of execute-task
   Please check that the tick interrupt is actually running. ( vTaskDelay )
   You can do this by placing a break point in the tick interrupt handler, defined within port.c.

2) switch-regs at the start of each task and
   end-task at the end of each task are needed to avoid an exception.

3) Can't use quit in a task.

4) pre-emptive multitasking hangs lwip-select and lwip_accept.

5) For exceptions like: mStack canary watchpoint triggered (NAME) or stackoverflow
   Increase the stack in extend.c higher than 3072 in xTaskCreate

6) key? in a task will hang the task.

7) When global or task: are used they must be placed in RAM. This file may in ROM.

8) The floating point stack is NOT changed when a new task is activated.
   Use floating point operations only in the main task.

\ Layout of private storage for a new task:
\ Space             Size
\ -----             ----
\ User Area         user-size
\ Parameter Stack   /task-stack
\ Tib               /tib
\ Return Stack      /task-rs
\ .
\ The dictionary and the Parameter Stack share an area equal
\ to the task storage area size minus user-size minus task-rs-size
\
\ The terminal input buffer and the Return Stack share an area of
\ size task-rs-size.  Tib grows up, Return Stack grows down.

\ Increase this to give the task a larger return stack
#20 cells value /task-rs

\ Increase this to give the task a larger data stack
#20 cells value /task-stack

\ Increase this to give the task a larger stack size for RTOS
#3072 value stack_size

\ Before the new task has been forked, invoking the task name will
\ return the address of its body.  After forking, it will return the
\ address of its user area
\ The task's body contains the address and size
